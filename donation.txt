If you make a donation, you reward me for the countless hours I've spent to
build this software, and encourage me to keep contributing to the hacking
community.

In addition, you will get new programs that I've written before the public
release, and extra nice support on my work and help on hacking in general.

Finally, your name will be listed below, so every body sees your generosity. :)

Please think about it.
